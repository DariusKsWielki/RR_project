# Reproducible Research project - Menthal Health in Tech 

## Dataset used in our resarch 

The data we used can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/code/andradaolteanu/model-and-visualize-mental-health-in-tech/notebook?fbclid=IwAR1HAGSxsHbl5Z9WGW-NQ9zSNXM0wMM7rRzexQd3QoJ4FmeYct3QoJ4F. We worked on the 2016 OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey. It had 1433 rows and 63 columns, lot's of missing data, lot's of not integrated data (gender for example was left an open question), lot's of countries but not consistent in number of respondents etc.

## New observations

Using our network of contacts, we asked the same questions to 50 people working in IT. We then added these observations to the existing dataset and watched the results change.


```python
new_observations = pd.read_excel('new_observations.xlsx')

## Data Cleaning 

##### Since many questions were open, it was necessary to clean the data. Therefore, the following changes were made:

* rename columns
* sex columns & company size recoded
* removed outliers from age
* missing value listwise deletion (for variables where missing observations were more than half) and simple imputation
* column encoding
* country filtering (remained only with the ones with more than 30 responses)
* create tech column with flag 1/0

## Data Analyst 

Part of the data analysis was divided into three stages. First, the analysis was repeated on the original data. Then the same analysis was carried out on the new data to see what distributions of variables we are dealing with. The final part was to repeat the analysis on the combined original data and our observations to see if the new data significantly changed the distributions of the variables. The results are shown below.

#### Missing data analyst

In original data, we had only 4 participant from Poland. Now with added new observations, it already started to show up on results as for Poland, we already have more than 30 results.

It seems that majority number of males among participants is also the same for Poland as well. But because of number of new observations compared to original data is too small, it does't affect to result much, but on average 0.4% more for each.

Actually the same follows for these as we can notice slight changes on results either more or less.

## Modeling methal health 

#### Ten machine learning models were used to model the mh_disorder_current variable:

* Naive Bayes
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* KNN
* Decission trees
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Nets
* Cross Gradient Booster 
* Cross Gradient Booster (Random Forest)

#### Two best models that on orginal dataset:

#### Models after hyperparamters tuning: 

##### Random Forest

## Conclusions 

 * The best model for the original data turned out to be the regular Random Forest with a score of 0.75 followed by the SVM with a score of 0.74194. This result was different from that obtained in the original work.
 * By greedy search on the model's hyperparameters it was possible to improve the SVM result to the level of 0.747. It was, however, not enough to beat Random Forest score.
 * The results changed with the addition of observations. It is noticeable that most of the models obtained worse results.
 * This time the best was XGBRFClassifier with an accuracy score of 0.749, and the second was the regular Random Forest with a score of 0.73902. Tuning on hyperparameters failed to improve this result.
 * In both cases, the same variables turned out to be the most important and the limitation of the variables brought about an improvement in the results.
