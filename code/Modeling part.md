### Excluding non numeric columns from dataset


```python
model_data = prep_data.copy()
model_data = model_data[col_numeric]
```

### Model data is our new dataset for predicting variable 'mh_disorder_current'


```python
y = model_data['mh_disorder_current']
cols = [col for col in model_data.columns if col not in ['mh_disorder_current']]
X = model_data[cols]

# Data Validation
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

### Function for checking performance of models


```python
def model_assess(model, name='Default'):
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    preds = model.predict(X_test)
    print('---', name, '---', '\n',
          confusion_matrix(y_test, preds), '\n',
          'Accuracy:', round(accuracy_score(y_test, preds), 5), '\n')
```

## New dataset

### Prepare data on new dataset


```python
survey_2016 = pd.read_csv('dane_RR.csv')
new_observations = pd.read_excel('new_observations.xlsx')
```


```python
new_observations = new_observations.rename(columns = {'Do you have medical coverage (private insurance or state-provided) which includes treatment of Â mental health issues?':'Do you have medical coverage (private insurance or state-provided) which includes treatment of  mental health issues?'})
```


```python

## Modeling on new dataset


```python
model_data = prep_data.copy()
model_data = model_data[col_numeric]
```

### Model data is our new dataset for predicting variable 'mh_disorder_current'


```python
y = model_data['mh_disorder_current']
cols = [col for col in model_data.columns if col not in ['mh_disorder_current']]
X = model_data[cols]

# Data Validation
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

### Function for checking performance of models


```python
def model_assess(model, name='Default'):
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    preds = model.predict(X_test)
    print('---', name, '---', '\n',
          confusion_matrix(y_test, preds), '\n',
          'Accuracy:', round(accuracy_score(y_test, preds), 5), '\n')
```

### Testing performance of selected models


```python
# Naive Bayes
nb = GaussianNB()
model_assess(nb, name='Naive Bayes')

# Stochastic Gradient Descent
sgd = SGDClassifier(max_iter=5000, random_state=0)
model_assess(sgd, name='SGD')

# KNN
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=19)
model_assess(knn, name='KNN')

# Decission trees
tree = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model_assess(tree, 'Decission Trees')

# Random Forest
rforest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=1000, max_depth=10, random_state=0)
model_assess(rforest, 'Random Forest')

# Support Vector Machine
svm = SVC(decision_function_shape="ovo")
model_assess(svm, 'SVM')

# Logistic Regression
lg = LogisticRegression(random_state=0, solver='lbfgs', multi_class='multinomial')
model_assess(lg, 'Logistic Regression')

# Neural Nets
nn = MLPClassifier(solver='lbfgs', alpha=1e-5, hidden_layer_sizes=(150, 10), random_state=1)
model_assess(nn, 'Neural Nets')

# Cross Gradient Booster
xgb = XGBClassifier(n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.05)
model_assess(xgb, 'XGBoost')

# Cross Gradient Booster (Random Forest) <=================== BEST
xgbrf = XGBRFClassifier(objective= 'multi:softmax')
